#  JAVELIN (Joint Autonomous Vehicle for Explosive LocatIoN)
## Overview
This project presents the development of a self-guided robot designed for accurate landmine detection. Leveraging an ESP8266 microcontroller and an A88 metal detector, the robot is capable of efficiently navigating through potentially hazardous terrain to identify buried threats. Additionally, integration of a Neo 6M GPS module and SIM 800L enables real-time data transmission, allowing for remote monitoring of detected threats.

## Key Features
Utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller and A88 metal detector for precise landmine detection.
Integration of Neo 6M GPS module and SIM 800L facilitates real-time data transmission.
Implementation of Blynk IoT app enables remote control functionality, enhancing operational safety and efficiency.
